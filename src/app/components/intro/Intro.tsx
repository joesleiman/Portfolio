                  Since starting my journey as a frontend developer 8 years ago, I&#39;ve built high-quality websites and hybrid mobile apps, shipped features on large-scale platforms like <strong>Bill.com</strong>, and created a full e-learning platform <strong>Ethrai</strong> serving over a million users. I&#39;ve collaborated with talented teams to turn complex problems into scalable, maintainable solutions. Quietly confident, naturally curious, and always focused on crafting digital experiences that both users and developers love.
